1. INTRODUCTION
===============

Thank you for trying this Chirpy! beta version. Note that, while every feature
contained in this product is functional unless stated otherwise, you may very
well run into problems here and there. However, in most cases, there's probably
an easy fix. You may find the following URLs helpful:

* Trackers (Bugs, Support, Feature Requests)
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=147270

* Chirpy! web site
  http://chirpy.sourceforge.net/

* API Specification (mainly for developers)
  http://chirpy.sourceforge.net/pod/


2. REQUIREMENTS
===============

To install Chirpy!, you'll need web space that gives you access to Perl 5.8 and
a SQL server running MySQL 4.1 or higher. Those version numbers are expected
to drop a little in an upcoming version.

In addition, you'll need these Perl modules:

Carp                Data::Dumper        HTML::Template
Digest::MD5         DBD::mysql          HTTP::Date
Encode              DBI                 URI::Escape
POSIX               Storable

It seems like a long list, but most of them are common and come with standard
distributions of Perl. Other modules will need to be installed separately; you
should probably ask your host about that. If any of these modules are missing,
Chirpy! will not work.

In addition, Chirpy! uses the CGI::Carp module for verbose error reporting,
which makes problems easier to trace. While this module is also really common,
you can drop the dependency by removing statements containing "CGI::Carp" or
"set_message" from the scripts.


3. INSTALLATION
===============

If all the requirements are met, you are ready to begin the installation of
Chirpy!. Let's go!

3.1. Copy files
---------------

Since you're reading this file, we'll assume that you've already extracted the
entire installation package.

First, we'll take a quick look at the contents of the package. You should have
the following directories and files in the root:

res/                The resources directory. Resources are public files that
                    are required by themes, such as images and style sheets.
src/                The source directory. Contains all the necessary files to
                    run Chirpy!, including its modules, locales, templates and
                    configuration file.
util/               Contains some utilities that you may find useful while
                    installing or using Chirpy!.
.htaccess           Has some directives that enable short URLs. Covered later
                    in this document.
changelog.txt       All the stuff that's changed between Chirpy! releases.
index.cgi           The main script. Will be the only URL that is accessed
                    directly by visitors.
install.txt         This document.
license.txt         The GNU General Public License, under which Chirpy! is
                    distributed.

Now, we're going the copy the files to a public path on the web server. This is
usually done using an FTP client.

As for the files in the package root directory, the only one you really need is
index.cgi. Since this is a Perl script, it has to be inside a path where the
server allows execution of scripts. Most servers these days will allow that
anywhere, but yours might require that you put it inside a cgi-bin/ directory,
which may even be outside the document root on the FTP server. This is no
problem--just make sure it wants to execute it and not display the contents.

The index.cgi file needs some attributes. This is done by issueing a SITE CHMOD
command on the FTP server. If you use a graphical FTP client, you can probably
right-click on the file and tick off the necessary attributes. They are:

                    Owner     READ      WRITE     EXECUTE
                    Group     READ      -         EXECUTE
                    Others    READ      -         EXECUTE

This translates to the string representation "rwxr-xr-x" or, numerically, 755
on UNIX systems. On most systems, this step is essential. You will get an error
page if you fail to change the file's attributes. Also, if you are using an FTP
client, make sure you have uploaded index.cgi in ASCII (text) mode, not image
(binary).

You may want to copy the .htaccess file from the package root as well. Make
sure you don't confuse it with the one in the src/ directory! The one covered
here allows you to use short URLs, which are easy to remember, using the
mod_rewrite Apache module. To use that option, you will need to run Chirpy! on
an Apache web server that has the mod_rewrite module. Note that, while short
URLs will not work if mod_rewrite is not enabled, it should be safe to have the
.htaccess file there anyway, since it checks for the module first. Moreover, it
also attempts to block access to the configuration file, so you might want to
have it anyway; we will cover that configuration file in a moment.

The res/ directory only holds static files and should reside in a public path
on the server, like <http://www.yourserver.com/chirpy/res>. You can upload it
anywhere, even on a different server. We'll need the URL later for the
configuration.

Next up: the src/ directory. This one does not have to be publicly accessible
and for security reasons, it really shouldn't be either. Chirpy! takes some
precautions to disallow access to it by placing a .htaccess file in it, that
holds code specific to the Apache web server. However, placing the directory
outside the document root (if possible) is a MUCH safer choice.
Alternatively, you can keep chirpy.ini, the configuration file, which we will
cover later in this document, outside the document root and the src/ directory.

Inside the src/ directory, you will find a directory called cache/. Make sure
it is empty. Also, it needs to be world-writable, i.e. its attributes must be
set to "rwxrwxrwx" or 777.

The util/ directory should NOT be uploaded. You are however likely to need the
setup.pl script inside it, but we'll get to that in a moment.

That covers uploading the files--almost. We'll need to upload a configuration
file at the end of the next step.

3.2. Configure
--------------

Chirpy! stores its configuration in a standard .INI file, a basic format which
is common on Windows systems. In this step, we'll create such a configuration
file.

By default, Chirpy! looks for chirpy.ini in the working directory (which is
where you put index.cgi) and inside the src/ directory if it is directly inside
the working directory. Otherwise, you will have to edit index.cgi. As explained
above, that little bit of editing is recommended, so your configuration file
resides outside the public domain. After all, it will contain your MySQL server
password, and we don't want visitors to read that, now, do we?

Right, let's create that chirpy.ini file now. Here is a basic example:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[general]
title=My Little QDB
base_path=./src
locale=en-US
rating_limit_count=2
rating_limit_time=60
update_check=1

[data]
type=MySQL
mysql.hostname=localhost
mysql.port=3306
mysql.username=my_username
mysql.password=my_password
mysql.database=my_database
mysql.prefix=chirpy_

[ui]
type=WebApp
date_time_format=%Y-%m-%d %H:%M GMT
date_format=%Y-%m-%d
time_format=%H:%M GMT
use_gmt=1
quotes_per_page=10
recent_news_items=3
public_moderation_queue=1
webapp.webmaster_name=John Doe
webapp.webmaster_email=you@yourserver.com
webapp.site_url=http://www.yourserver.com/cgi-bin/chirpy
webapp.resources_url=http://www.yourserver.com/chirpy/res
webapp.theme=default
webapp.welcome_text_file=welcome.html
webapp.cookie_domain=yourserver.com
webapp.cookie_path=/cgi-bin/chirpy
webapp.session_expiry=+3d
webapp.enable_short_urls=0
webapp.enable_feeds=0
webapp.quotes_per_feed=50
webapp.enable_gzip=0
webapp.enable_captchas=0
webapp.enable_autolink=0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot of the values don't look very interesting right now, but we'll have to
change some of the others.

3.2.1. The [general] Section
----------------------------

title               Change this value to the title you want your QDB to have.
base_path           Enter the absolute or relative path to the src/ directory
                    here. When using relative paths, this is again relative to
                    the directory where index.cgi is.
update_check        Set this to 1 to tell Chirpy! to automatically check for
                    updates periodically. Only site owners will be informed of
                    available updates. This feature requires that libwww-perl
                    (LWP) be installed; if it is not, Chirpy! will just show
                    you an informative error message.

3.2.2. The [data] Section
-------------------------

mysql.hostname      Enter the name of the MySQL server here. Usually, this will
                    be "localhost".
mysql.port          Enter the port the MySQL server uses. The default is 3306.
mysql.username      Enter your MySQL username. This is not necessarily the same
                    as your regular username.
mysql.password      Enter your MySQL password. This is not necessarily the same
                    as your regular password.
mysql.database      Enter the name of the MySQL database Chirpy! should use. If
                    it does not exist, you need to create it first. Do not
                    create any tables; Chirpy! will do that for you.
mysql.prefix        If you only have one MySQL database, Chirpy! can make its
                    tables easy to find by prefixing their names with the text
                    you enter here. The default "chirpy_" is a wise choice.

3.2.3. The [ui] Section
-----------------------

webapp.webmaster_name
                    Your name.
webapp.webmaster_email
                    Your e-mail address. Don't worry about spam, Chirpy! will
                    use some fancy tricks to hide it.
webapp.site_url     The URL where you put index.cgi.
webapp.resources_url
                    The URL where you put the res/ directory.
webapp.cookie_domain
                    Essentially the domain name (without the www prefix) from
                    your site's URL. This will be used to store cookies.
webapp.cookie_path  The part that comes after the domain in the site URL. This
                    will also be used to store cookies.
webapp.enable_short_urls
                    Change this to 1 to enable the short URLs feature described
                    above. If you get "Not Found" errors while browsing the QDB
                    later, you should turn it off.
webapp.enable_feeds Chirpy! can offer an RSS 2.0 feed and an Atom 1.0 feed of
                    the Quotes of the Week, so visitors can syndicate them. If
                    you want to enable those, set this to 1.
webapp.quotes_per_feed
                    This is the maximum number of quotes to include in a feed.
                    In theory, Chirpy! can provide a content feed for any page,
                    and since feeds do not offer "Previous"/"Next" links, this
                    should be a sensible number. The default is 50.
webapp.enable_gzip  Chirpy! can greatly decrease bandwidth usage by compressing
                    output on the fly if the browser supports it. Set this to 1
                    to enable that. It requires the Compress::Zlib Perl module.
webapp.enable_captchas
                    If you wish to prevent malicious users from spamming the
                    quote submission page, you will want to use captcha images.
                    Setting this value to 1 enables them. This feature requires
                    the Authen::Captcha Perl module.
webapp.enable_autolink
                    Change this to 1 to automatically turn URLs and e-mail
                    addresses in quote bodies into hyperlinks. This feature is
                    still sort of experimental, but should work fine.

If you enable the captcha feature, you will need to define some of the following
values as well. You may want to turn the feature off at first, so you can
test-drive Chirpy!'s other features before trying captcha support.

webapp.captcha_image_path
                    The physical path to the directory where captcha images are
                    to be stored. Since visitors will need to view these images,
                    the directory must be accessible via HTTP. Typically, it is
                    "res/captcha". Make sure the directory is world-writable,
                    i.e. drwxrwxrwx.
webapp.captcha_image_url
                    The URL to the captcha image path, i.e. where visitors will
                    access captcha images. Hence, it must be the URL to the
                    directory you set webapp.captcha_image_path to.
webapp.captcha_code_length
                    The number of characters in the captcha code. Defaults to 4.
webapp.captcha_expiry_time
                    The number of seconds between the moment when the captcha
                    image was generated and the moment when its code expires.
                    Defaults to 300.
webapp.captcha_source_image_path
                    The physical path to the source images to be used by the
                    Authen::Captcha module. Check the Authen::Captcha package
                    for an examples of this image pack. Defaults to the path of
                    the images bundled with Authen::Captcha.
webapp.captcha_character_width
                    The pixel width of each character in a captcha image. The
                    total image width will be the number of characters,
                    multiplied by this value. Defaults to the width of images
                    bundled with Authen::Captcha.
webapp.captcha_character_height
                    The pixel height of each character in a captcha image. The
                    image height will be equal to this value. Defaults to the
                    height of images bundled with Authen::Captcha.

That covers the configuration file. Save it as chirpy.ini and, as stressed
before, try to store it at a location on the server which cannot be accessed
using a Web browser.

Now, we'll have to modify index.cgi a little to tell it where to find the
configuration file. Again, it looks for chirpy.ini in the working directory and
inside src/, but hopefully, it won't be there. So we'll just open index.cgi in
a text editor and change the line

  chirpy;

to the following:

  chirpy('/path/to/chirpy.ini');

Again, you can use either an absolute path or a path relative to the working
directory. You'll also need this path in the next step.

While we're editing index.cgi, there are two more things you might have to
change. The first is the path to the modules/ directory inside src/. This path
is stored like:

  unshift @INC, 'src/modules';

If you have not placed the src/ directory in the same directory as index.cgi,
update the path so Perl can find the Chirpy! modules.

The other thing you might have to change is the path to Perl itself. Most
servers have it at /usr/bin/perl, but if yours doesn't, change the first line
of index.cgi to "#!" followed by the exact path to Perl.

3.3. Setup
----------

Now that all the files are there, we'll grab setup.pl from the util/ directory
and open it in a text editor. Look for the line that reads

  my $ch = new Chirpy();

and change that to

  my $ch = new Chirpy('/path/to/chirpy.ini');

using the same path you entered in index.cgi. In addition, you will have to
update the path to src/modules/ and Perl itself again, if you had to do so for
index.cgi.

Now, upload setup.pl to the directory where index.cgi resides and change its
attributes so they are the same as index.cgi's; as described above, they should
be rwxr-xr-x (755). Again, since this is a Perl script, upload in ASCII mode!

Now, we're going to call your Web browser into action. Open it and surf to the
URL where setup.pl should be now, e.g.

  http://www.yourserver.com/cgi-bin/chirpy/setup.pl

That should give you a basic page, welcoming you to the setup procedure. If
not, let's go over a few common problems ...

- If you get the source code of setup.pl or maybe a download window, the server
  doesn't allow execution of Perl scripts in that directory. You'll probably
  need to use the cgi-bin directory instead.

- If you get a Forbidden error, you probably didn't change the script's
  attributes properly, as described above.

- If you get a fairly verbose error that has line numbers and lots of weird
  characters and other stuff that confuses you in it, the server executed the
  script, but it crashed somewhere along the way. Something may have gone wrong
  with the upload of one or more files; upload them again. If that doesn't do
  any good, paste the error message at the Support Tracker, to which you can
  find the URL at the start of this document.

- If you get a generic "Internal Server Error" page, the server most likely
  failed to execute the script at an earlier stage. Some files may have gotten
  corrupted in the upload process; try uploading them again. If that doesn't
  help, go over the text above to see if you didn't miss anything. If problems
  persist, your host can give you a copy of the server's error log, which may
  tell you more. If you can get an error message from the log, you can post
  that at the Support Tracker; without it, the error will be nearly impossible
  to trace.

Assuming you've reached the setup page now, you get to decide if you want to
keep your existing installation if any. If you're installing Chirpy! for the
first time, you should choose to keep data, since it's faster. That should give
you a page with a basic event log for the setup procedure. If it tells you the
setup procedure has been completed, you can go to the next step now. If not,
take a look at the error and see if you can fix things. If not, try the Support
Tracker for assistance.

3.4. Import
-----------

This step is optional. It only applies if you have the Rash Quote Management
System installed and you want to migrate its data to Chirpy!. If you have no
idea what this is about, just skip this step.

To import Rash's data, grab chirpy_rqms_import.php from the util/ directory.
Open it in a text editor and edit the configuration values at the start of the
script. Then place it in the directory where you installed Rash, so it can find 
config.php. Surf to chirpy_rqms_import.php and everything should be clear from
there. If anything goes wrong, try the Support Tracker.


4. UPGRADING
============

If you are upgrading from Chirpy! version 0.1 or 0.2, you should just move the
updated setup.pl script from the "util" directory into Chirpy!'s root directory
for a second, make it executable, and surf to it. Chirpy! will then ask you if
you want to perform a fresh installation or an upgrade. Now, DO *NOT* CLICK ON
"FRESH INSTALLATION," because you would lose all your quotes, accounts, etc.
Instead, click the "UPGRADE" button, wait for the page to load, watch Chirpy!
inform you of the successful upgrade, and remove setup.pl again.

Additionally, as Chirpy! 0.3 offers quite a couple of new features, you will
probably want to play with those. Most of them just come down to adding a line
in the configuration file. For captchas, you will need to create a couple of
directories; just scroll back to section 3.2, where the configuration file is
explained--it's all there. Enjoy!


5. RUN CHIRPY!
==============
 _____________________________________________________________________________
|                                                                             |
|    !!! DON'T FORGET TO REMOVE THE SETUP SCRIPT FROM THE SERVER FIRST !!!    |
|_____________________________________________________________________________|

By now, the setup script should have directed you to your brand new Chirpy!
installation already. If not, append /index.cgi to your site URL and open that
URL. That should give you a cute little start page. You should be able to leave
off index.cgi in the URL now--try it. If it doesn't work, you should definitely
turn short URLs off. If something else goes wrong, you should try the Support
Tracker; the URL is at the beginning of this file.

Now, you're pretty much finished. Except that you should change the default
password. Surf to the administration section, log in as "superuser" with the
password "password" (if you didn't poke at setup.pl already) and click on the
"Manage Accounts" option. Select the "superuser" account and modify it.

That concludes the installation of Chirpy!. I hope you'll enjoy it. If you run
into a problem or you'd like to see a new feature in the next release, surf to
the Trackers.

Congratulations on a successful installation!


6. NEXT STEPS
=============

Now that you've got a working Chirpy! installation, you can tweak it to your
liking. Most of this is done from the configuration file. If you want to change
the welcome message, you just edit the file welcome.html in the src/ directory,
which is actually a template.

As Chirpy! is a work in progress, you can expect a lot more documentation on
customizing it in future releases. In the mean time, if you want to do more
advanced tweaking, here are a few possible scenarios:

6.1. Your Own Theme
-------------------

The easiest way to do this is to copy the existing "default" theme and modify
it, after which you change webapp.theme in the configuration file to use the
new theme. A theme is nothing but two directories named after it: the one in
src/themes/ holds the templates for the theme, the one in res/ holds its
resources. The template filenames are predefined, so you need to keep those
intact. The templates are parsed by the HTML::Template Perl module, so you will
probably have to look at its documentation for a second--or you could just
learn to use it by looking at the default theme's source code. The manual page
for HTML::Template can be found at

  http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Template/Template.pm

6.2. Your Own Locale
--------------------

You might want Chirpy! in your own language, and you can have it too. If you
look in the src/locales/ directory, you'll see that locales are actually just
INI files. Each locale string, along with some basic instructions for locale
creation, is documented in the POD, located at the URL at the start of this
document.

6.3. Your Own Data Manager
--------------------------

Chirpy! is extremely modular. If you'd rather have it store its data in your
choice of database, you are free to implement the Chirpy::DataManager class.
Its API is explained in the POD, which is available at the start of this
document or by typing "perldoc Chirpy::DataManager" from a console or command
prompt, if you have Perl installed.

6.4. Your Own User Interface
----------------------------

Apart from creating a backend, you can also write your own frontend class. This
class should implement Chirpy::UI. Unfortunately, the API documentation for it
is not yet available. Note that if your UI would be a web site, you should
probably just create a Chirpy::UI::WebApp theme as described in 5.1.

If you've created a theme, a locale, a data manager or a UI, please share your
work with the community! E-mail it to me at ceetee@users.sourceforge.net and it
might be included in the next Chirpy! release by default. Obviously, you would
get credit for it.
